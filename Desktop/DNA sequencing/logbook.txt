October
- Discussed and planned the scope of the project and what research will be conducted
- Read papers by Kate Attfield and David Mckay on Watermark coding

November
- Started work on the channel model channel.py to include Unigram channel
- Started work on Trellis class for the forward backward algorithm

December
- Finished Trellis class and explored other decoding schemes such as viterbi
- Collected data by running simulations on only the inner code and plotted them
- Created powerpoint presentation of current progress

January
- Worked on write up for TMR
- Considered further tasks to continue the project

February
- Implemented the Bigram Model for the channel.py class
- Built the 3D Trellis class with the forward backward algorithm

March
- Created the sparsifier module as part of the hierarchical coding scheme
- Integrated the LDPC code module into the coding scheme

April 
- Started work on the Sparsifier decoder
- Integrated the whole hierarchical coding scheme together

May
- Collected data using the departments servers by making investigation files
- Made use of parallel programming to collect data and then plot it
- Wrote the final report for the project
- Wrote the Technical Abstract
