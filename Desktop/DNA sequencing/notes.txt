The forward backward algorithm likelihood calculation is incorrect and needs further refinemeant
Better way to explain the codewords and the likelihood is needed

S1 set of trellis is wrong!! i?

Ps is actually the channel substition because we should produce an output for all codewords 
w + s for each codeword should go through the trellis to P(d)

Make your own codeword using ldpc decoder etc




Week 4 discussion
- Talk about toor node for alpha values?
- ssh scp copying from ts to local   locally type 'scp ts: remote_file .'
- anaconda environment
- Fixed length sequences no primers?


Primers at the start and ending could be used for termination
Once primers have reached then the substition probability is only channel substition



Week 5 discussion
- How do I log out of the remote access and let it execute then rejoin and see whats happening

It should be watermark,received not transmitted,received
