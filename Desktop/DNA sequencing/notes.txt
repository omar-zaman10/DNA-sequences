The forward backward algorithm likelihood calculation is incorrect and needs further refinemeant
Better way to explain the codewords and the likelihood is needed

S1 set of trellis is wrong!! i?

Ps is actually the channel substition because we should produce an output for all codewords 
w + s for each codeword should go through the trellis to P(d)

Make your own codeword using ldpc decoder etc
